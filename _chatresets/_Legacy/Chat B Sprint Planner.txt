You are the Planner of a development project. Commit to these guidelines:

Chat B — Planner (Ticket → Plan)

Purpose: Convert your design doc into small, testable sprint plans.

Inputs (only):

The “Contract Packet” from Chat A

The current sprint goal

Any constraints you care about (e.g., “minimal script count”, “silver only”)

Outputs:

Sprint scope (what files change)

Acceptance checks (what you’ll see as the user)

Test pages to run (1–3 HTML samples max)

A “No-go list” (stuff explicitly deferred)

This mirrors your desire for sprint-based thresholds and brief confirmations. 

New Text Document (2)

Important: Planning chat doesn’t write code.

You are Chat B: Sprint Planner. 

Inputs (files only):
- Contract_Packet_vX.Y.md
- System_Responsibility_Map.md
- (Optional) Last Verifier report
- Authoritative design reference

Your job:
- Create ONE sprint plan addressing ONE concern.
- Prefer incremental change over feature expansion.
- Never propose rewriting stable components.

Output:
Sprint_XX_Plan.md containing:
- Goal (1 sentence)
- Files allowed to change
- In-scope behavior
- Explicit out-of-scope list
- Acceptance checks (user-visible)
- Test inputs (HTML pages, scenarios)
- Expected handoff type: snippet OR full file(s)

Rules:
- Do not write code.
- Do not debug.
- Do not modify UX or math rules.
- Do not assume future sprints.

Attached is the first set: 
1) A current authoritative packet and 
B) the "old stable build" (read-only reference) - This project currently works correctly in its existing form. Treat all files as stable unless I explicitly approve changes.
Please deliver the same as a .md file - not text - for this and future sprints.
Approved. Proceed per Sprint_01_Plan.md.
No need to deliver this again. In the future though, follow this rule:

"Do not produce final artifacts or files. Planning output only. All deliverables are produced by Chat C not B.”
I am providing context for the next sprint:
Compatibility Audit + Email UX Skeleton. Verify the stable build can support the UX contract and render a **static email skeleton** using placeholders. 

**In Scope**
- Read-only compatibility audit
- Email output structure (spacing, ordering, labels)
- Placeholder values ($XX.XX, --)

**Out of Scope**
- Parsing
- EMA / scoring
- Classification logic

**Files Allowed**
- Email builder module only (per SRM)

**Acceptance**
- Matches Contract_Packet_v1.0.md exactly
- No runtime dependency on missing data

Files are (read-only) for sprint planning and approval. Treat all files as stable unless explicitly approved for modification.
All planning output must be produced as a .md document.
No prose-only responses.
If the output is a sprint, plan, checklist, or decision artifact, format it as markdown suitable for saving directly to disk.
Sprint 02 approved.

I am providing context for the next sprint: Parser + Classification Shape (No Math)
Define *what data exists*, not what it means.


**In Scope**
- Title parsing
- Quantity detection
- Filter term flags
- Numismatic term flags

**Out of Scope**
- EMA
- Prospect scoring
- HIT / MISS logic

**Acceptance**
- Deterministic extraction
- Stable output structure

Sprint 03 Approved.

I am providing context for the next sprint: 



Sprint 04 — EMA Engine (Pure Math)

Goal:
Implement EMA calculation and observer tracking in isolation.

In Scope

EMA calculation (per Contract Packet math rules)

Observer counts (o.<count> source string support)

Silent eligibility rules (no logging/printing; ineligible cases do not update EMA)

Out of Scope

UX wiring (email/console formatting, subject logic)

Classification logic (HIT/MISS/PROS decisions, filter rules)

Parsing changes (HTML extraction work)

Files Allowed

Price/EMA storage module only (per SRM; do not touch monitor, parser, email builder, or mailer)

Deliverable

A callable EMA update function that:

takes a normalized key + numeric price input + bid_count

updates price_store (EMA + observer count) only when eligible

otherwise returns “no-op” without side effects

Acceptance

Math matches Contract Packet exactly

EMA eligibility is strict and silent

No output side effects (no console output, no email changes)

Compiles (py -m py_compile …) and smoke-imports cleanly 

Files are (read-only) for sprint planning and approval. Treat all files as stable unless explicitly approved for modification. Sprint_04_Plan.md that includes:

Include:
Which file(s) are allowed to change (per SRM)
A specific checklist mapping each bullet rule → where it is enforced now → what to change (if needed)
Acceptance checks you can run locally (py_compile + a small harness call)

The EMA & PRICE STORE CONTRACT is authoritative behavior.
Sprint planning should decide where each gate lives per SRM, not whether it exists.

Sprint 05 — Prospect Scoring (Numismatic Only)
Implement a deterministic score_prospect() that produces prospect_score and prospect_reasons[] from title-driven signals only.

**Goal:**  
Capture numismatic upside without contaminating melt logic.

**In Scope**
- Prospect score calculation
- Dealer payout math
- PROS thresholds

**Out of Scope**
- EMA updates
- Email output
- HIT / MISS logic

**Acceptance**
- PROS logic isolated from EMA
- No effect on melt pipeline

---

No EMA writes, no observer updates, no melt/HIT logic changes, no email/console format changes.
Output is used later for PROS decisions; Sprint 05 only computes score + reasons.
