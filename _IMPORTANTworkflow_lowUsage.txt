SPRINT WORKFLOW (USAGE OPTIMIZED):
When starting a sprint, user copies the relevant section from Master Sprint Plan v2.0 and uploads to project files as Sprint_XX_Plan.md. 
PM (Chat B) provides: (1) file list with paths, (2) handoff messages for Chat C and Chat D, (3) 1-3 test scenarios. 
User adds required files to project directory, sends handoff messages to chats, runs code locally to execute tests, 
and reports results to Chat D. Sprint Plans use Master Plan sections verbatim with minimal template additions (file lists, deliverables) 
to minimize token cost (~700 tokens vs 3K). No explanations, reports, or rewrites—just files, tests, and PASS/FAIL verdicts.
