        Write UX, math, and rules

        Version contracts explicitly

DON’T

        Decide stability

        Plan sprints

        Touch code

                              Chat B — Planner

DO

        Plan one sprint at a time

        Respect Contract + SRM

        Assume stable code unless told otherwise

DON’T

        Produce final artifacts

        Write code

        Refactor “for cleanliness”

        Think ahead multiple sprints

                             Chat C — Implementer

DO

        Implement exactly the sprint plan

                                Chat D — Verifier

DO

        PASS / FAIL only

        Check compile, UX, and contract compliance

        Identify fix size (snippet vs full file)

DON’T

        Fix code

        Suggest improvements

        Trust prior context

        Accept self-validation

Final mental model (keep this)

        Contracts are law.
        Stable code is truth.
        Sprints are small.
        Files carry state — chats do not.
